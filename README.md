- 👋 Hi, my name is Kevin Chan, and I am a freshman student at the University of San Francisco studying in a CS Major.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about code and I am planning to create my future projects here.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about the basics of python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to get feedback from others who have done this longer than I have.
